Dave on drums: Dave puts his all into his drumming...which ends up with a great night for you and a large bill for new sticks for him! He's solid...but flashy on the cymbals and likes a nice stadium finish ;)

Andrew on bass: Andrew has played in rock bands and covers bands. He's even played for Morris Men and for barn dances. What he tends to keep quiet is that in 1986 his band knocked The Smiths off the No.1 spot in the Indie charts...his bass emits a noise that seems to be directly connected to people's hips and gets them a-wiggling towards the dance-floor...

John on keys: If you can hum it, John can play it. In fact, even if you can't hum it, John can play it, 'cos he can play anything! And smile at the same time, because there's no doubt that John's never happier than when he's tinkling the ivories and watching the music-magic happen at your party :)

Shezza on guitar & vocals: The voice of Bryan Adams matched with the guitar of...well actually he's pretty good at imitating many many guitarists and is stunningly awesome when he's being Shezza as well!

Angela on vocals & myriad weird percussive things: As well as being a singer, Angela is a professional presenter and host, so when you ask Chaos to your event, you can be sure she'll set the right tone, tuning into what's needed and making sure everyone has a great time.
