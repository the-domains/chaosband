Chaos is a scalable band; we can go down to as few a two members for a keys & vocal duo or we can add extra vocals, guitar & brass, but the core Chaos causers are:

Dave on drums:  Dave puts his all into his drumming...which ends up with a great night for you and a large bill for new sticks for him!  He's solid...but flashy on the cymbals and likes a nice stadium finish ;)

Andrew on bass: Andrew has played in rock bands and covers bands. He's played for Morris Men and for barn dances. What he tends to keep quiet is that in 1986 his band kept The Smiths off the No.1 spot in the Indie charts...his bass emits a noise that seems to be directly connected to people's hips and gets them a-wiggling towards the dancefloor...

John on keys: If you can hum it, John can play it. In fact, even if you can't hum it, John can play it, 'cos he can play anything! And smile at the same time, because there's no doubt that John's never happier than when he's tinkling the ivories and watching the music-magic happen at your party :)

Shezza on guitar & vocals: The voice of Bryan Adams matched with the guitar of...well actually he's pretty good at imitating many many guitarists and is stunningly awesome when he's being Shezza as well!

Angela on vocals & myriad weird percussive things: As well as a singer, Angela is a professional presenter and host. So when you hire Chaos, you're not hiring a band that will just turn up and play some stuff. You know you'll be getting some skilful crowd-handling, too.
