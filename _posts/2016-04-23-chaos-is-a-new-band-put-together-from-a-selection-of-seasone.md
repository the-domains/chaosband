Chaos is a new band put together from a selection of seasoned musicians to give audiences a great time and an eclectic mix of music.  
Featuring rock, funk, pop, indie, prog and more, you'll never know what's coming next ;)

Currently a 5-piece line-up, Chaos is perfect for your 'zeroey' birthday party, village beer festival, charity ball or work 'do'...as long as you're happy to dance all night and enjoy our eclectic setlist.
