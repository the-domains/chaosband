Need a little (organised) Chaos in your life?

Email us: Hello@ChaosBand.co.uk  
YES! We will tune into your audience and interact with them, not just play stuff  
NO! We will not look at our shoes and mumble or take ourselves too seriously  
YES! We will listen to you and ask questions to make sure we understand what you want, not just turn up with a thrash metal setlist to a village festival ;)  
NO! We will not play Engelbert Humperdinck. Really sorry about that one, but it's against our religion...
